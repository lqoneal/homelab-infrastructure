# Zeus Operational Alpha Progress

Date: 2026-07-25  
Current completed mission: `ZEUS-P1-OPERATOR-INTERFACE`  
Resume status: qualified implementation candidate in the working tree

## Mission tracker

| Capability | State | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mission P0 repository-local operational bootstrap | Qualified | `engineering/evidence/2026-07-25-zeus-mission-p0-operational-bootstrap.md` |
| Mission P1 global launcher | Qualified | `engineering/evidence/2026-07-25-zeus-p1-operator-interface-evidence.md` |
| Mission P1 first-100-invocation orientation | Qualified | `engineering/evidence/2026-07-25-zeus-p1-operator-interface-evidence.md` |

## Resume point

The global command is an exact symbolic link managed by
`scripts/install-zeus-launcher`. Operator-interface state is schema version 1
at `.zeus/runtime/operator-interface-state.json`; orchestration remains at
`.zeus/runtime/orchestration-state.json`. Re-run the focused and regression
commands recorded in the P1 evidence before publication or later modification.

This progress record is operational project tracking only. It grants no
mission-selection, approval, WOP admission, execution, qualification, or
reconciliation authority.

## Backlog

- Consider a future separately authorized migration from environment-only
  suppression to a global `--no-intro` option if operator demand justifies it.
- Consider an explicitly qualified state-backup helper; current recovery is
  whole-file manual preservation and restore.
- Consider platform-specific locking support only if Zeus is ported beyond
  the current POSIX platform.

Recommended next Zeus mission: qualify operator-facing diagnostics for
launcher/state health and recovery without expanding orchestration authority.
